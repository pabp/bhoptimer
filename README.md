# shavit's bhop timer (ez autohop seattle bespoke ver)

This is (nearly) an all-in-one server plugin for Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2 that adds a timer system and many other utilities, so you can install it and have a proper bunnyhop server running.

Including a records system, map zones (start/end marks etc), bonuses, HUD with useful information, chat processor, miscellaneous such as weapon commands/spawn point generator, bots that replay the best records of the map, sounds, statistics, a fair & competitive rankings system and more!
